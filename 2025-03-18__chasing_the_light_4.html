<em>Word had spread. Sunlight! Sunlight in Barovia! Certainly there had been the rare occasion when a priest of Lanthander had channeled all of their divinity for a few scant moments of radiant dawn, or a mage who had burnt years of magical reserves to produce a concentrated ray of sunlight. And there were tales that some in this land could show the past, a past in which the cloud had not yet blotted out the sun.</em>

<em>But here was an island, in the far distance on Lake Zarovich, barely visible from the ahore, that had seen sunlight for <strong>minutes</strong> at a time, <strong>multiple days in a row</strong>. In a land of dark shadows, populated and ruled by darker creatures, sunlight was as precious a commodity as silver, and rarer.</em>

<em>And of course the local authorities would get involved, eapecially after the first few expeditions had proved treacherous. Adventurers had gone on their own and had met with varied levels of misfortune, but none as yet had learned--or at least announced that they had learned--of the source of the sunlight. And there lay opportunity.</em>

<em>Between Ismark, burgomaster of Barovia village, and Lady Wachter, burgomaster of Vallaki, whoever was first to discover the nature of the sunlight on the craggy island, they would sure be able to use it, one way or another, to grow their own power.</em>

&quot;Coin. Good coin, should you deliver me actionable information,&quot;  <em>Ismark had told several adventurers before sending them on their way. It was like feeding two crows with one crumb: he might learn something of use from the excursion, while getting several troublemaking adventurers out of his village.</em>

<strong>Enter Trippy</strong>

&gt;         &quot;Oops! My goodness, she begs your pardon, Eladrin-Friend. She&#x27;s very pleased to be somewhere other than Barovia Village. Almost as pleased as she is that we were able to undertake this journey together. She&#x27;s still a little disappointed that burgomaster Ismark seemed so eager to see us‚Äîwell, <em>her</em>‚Äîleave on this errand. And also that she had to pay out coin to burgomaster Wachter&#x27;s confidants just to learn the whereabouts of her domicile. Nevertheless, she is most intrigued by this light mystery.

&gt;         &quot;What do you think of all this, Ailluin?&quot;

<em>Hearing no immediate response, Trippy grows a bit nervous.</em>

&gt;         &quot;Is she talking too much? What a bother. She <em>is</em> sorry. As she mentioned during our long walk, this is not normal for her. She is normally quite taciturn herself. But something about this place has made her a bit babbly. She thinks it is perhaps the oppressiveness. It makes her overflow with energy in an attempt to push back the physical‚Äîand emotional‚Äîcloudiness.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The air here is thick, heavy with the scent of damp earth and something stale, something long past its prime. Qarin inhales deeply, tasting it, rolling it over her tongue like a vintage wine, finding it lacking. A shame.  

She steps forward, slow and deliberate, letting the sway of her robes and the whisper of silk against her skin fill the silence between words. The mansion ahead looms, a monument to faded grandeur, but her eyes flick first to the mottled garden, unkempt yet strangely manicured, like a corpse too carefully arranged for burial.  

<strong>Enter Qarin.  </strong>

She glides past the open iron gates with a carefully curated air of curiosity and mystique, her fingers drifting idly across the chill metal. She does not look toward the mansion‚Äôs door just yet. Let it wait.   

Instead, her gaze finds the figures already gathered, lingering just long enough to take them in. The winter-cloaked eladrin, sharp and glacial, who leaves a trail of frost in his wake. The small grey gnome, nervous and expressive, words tumbling from her lips in rippling cadence. Intriguing.</span>

&gt; &quot;Well, isn‚Äôt this a delicious little gathering?&quot;  

Her voice is warm, smoky, edged with amusement, as if she has walked into a performance and is eager to see how the first act unfolds.  

&gt; &quot;Burgomasters do love their games. I do wonder, though‚Ä¶&quot;  

She lifts her hands, brushing away an unseen speck of dust from her sleeve.  

&gt; &quot;Which of them is playing the better one?&quot;  

And with that, she steps forward to join Rook and the strangers, and despite the fact that she nearly stumbles over a cracked paving stone, her head held high, letting the hush of silk and the scent of coffee and sun-warmed fruit follow in her wake.  

Then her eyes alight on the small grey gnome again. There&#x27;s something familiar about the woman and she keeps her gaze on the her while she tries to remember. So many things have happened in the few days she&#x27;s been here and while her two companions have taken the most of her attention in that time, she <em>has</em> shared words with this little one. 

&gt; I am Qarin. I have seen you before, but I am afraid my mind has been a bit preoccupied for the last couple of days and I find myself at a loss. We have spoken, yes? &quot; she says to the gnome.</span>

She lifts a palm in a small, regal gesture, as if expecting to help a lady in a long, trailing dress step over down the last few steps of a staircase into a crystal-studded ballroom, instead of the grim, mocking garden they find themselves in.

When that paving stone almost trips Qarin up, Rook&#x27;s silent annoucement shifts to a steadying hand. Her dark fingers, nails a little cracked, linger but an inch from the silks of Qarin&#x27;s robes, pausing when Qarin catches herself.*

&quot;Careful, <strong>fenorain</strong>,&quot; <em>Rook warns, reproach tinged with fondness. She takes half a step back and palms the bow-staff, like a rower a long paddle while standing atop a river barge.</em>

&quot;Well, this Lady Wachter&#x27;s fellas are making a tidy little sum on the side. I&#x27;d say they are ahead for now.&quot;</span>

&gt; &quot;Pissing contest. She likes this. Thank you for the amusing image.&quot;

It is why she has decided to volunteer for this task of investigating the light, despite her misgivings.&quot;

<em>Trippy releases Qarin&#x27;s hand and steps back, looking out to the lake once more. <strong>If this were her homeland,</strong> she thinks, <strong>there is no way she would travel out onto that water.</strong></em></span>

&gt; &quot;I am glad I have both you and my god to look over me, <strong>thiravae</strong> [Celestial],&quot; she says with a small smile, trailing her fingers away from Rook&#x27;s hand.  

Her gaze shifts to Trippy. <em>Of course. Now she remembers. The third-person speech. She really should have recognized that, and the grey skin, immediately. Her lapse was perhaps excused by her confusion at the time. But it is not a good sign, even though the meeting is now clear in her head. This darling woman had helped her immensely with a few reassuring words and some directions.</em>  

&gt; &quot;And I thank you for it again. If I was of a rather rude disposition back in Barovia, I do apologize. You helped me get my bearings, and I am very grateful.&quot;  

She brings her second hand up, mirroring the clasp of Trippy&#x27;s hands. With a quick glance, she sends Rook a small smile before looking over her shoulder to meet Imhra‚Äôs eyes.  

Then she turns to the Eladrin, tucked into his frosty aura. Unperturbed, she holds out a hand.

<em>Imhra hangs back, just enough that the gnome and the elf may have missed her entirely at first--or merely have assumed she was not with the other two women. She reaches back to touch the tailpiece of her lute as if to reassure herself that the instrument hasn&#x27;t gone anywhere.</em>

<em>She lingers behind Rook and Qarin even as she closes the gap between herself and the rest of the group, letting them draw attention first. It seems strange--when meeting new people--to not be immediately seeking the spotlight. First impressions, after all. But she&#x27;s also not who she once was. And it has been an unexpected few days, even without the perpetual gloom of this place. She came here with little knowledge to lean on, so this is an opportunity to observe and discover where she might best slot into the new dynamic that always forms when people meet.</em>

<em>She has all these thoughts in the moments before she steps around to Rook to stand at her side. She is easily the tallest of the three women, though her slender build prevents her from seeming the most imposing despite that. Long ears that taper to a point mark her as an elf, and she carries herself with a gracefully upright posture that would seem to indicate an upbringing in high society of some form. Despite that, she wears her long, wavy burnished blonde hair down with small braids woven into it here or there. It gives her the kind of shaggy appearance that nonetheless manages to portray that she put effort into that look. She&#x27;s wearing a fine green cloak with silver threading along the edge.</em>

<em>She looks from Trippy to Ailluin, and while she doesn&#x27;t <strong>stare</strong> per se, there&#x27;s something almost wary about her gaze on him. Possibly nothing more than the typical posturing elves get up to when they have too much time and social power on their hands.</em></span>

<em>She smiles through Trippy&#x27;s introduction, the curl of her lips turning a touch playful at Qarin&#x27;s glance... but when the invisible thread of not-staring snaps taut between the frosty Eladrin and Imhra, she leans a little forward, and to the side.

<em>Something in Imhra&#x27;s self-introduction strikes her like a Stone Giant&#x27;s thrown boulder, however, and, for an instant, she has trouble maintaining her composure. These past few days of meditation and self-exploration had unlocked the door to a memory long-suppressed, and the boulder now smashes the door open as if it had never been locked in the first place.</em>

<em>Recovering quickly, Trpytivy mentally retreats from the others for a moment. She makes a concerted effort to park this revelation for later consideration. It is essential that she examine it fully, but now is not the time. If one or more of these new companions proves solid, perhaps she will even discuss it with them when the moment is right. <strong>Shadow</strong>, she tells herself silently, ensuring that this train of thought is stable enough to be recaptured later, before bringing her attention back to this dawn-light meeting.</em></span>

Her fingers, so scorned by the frostbitten elf‚Äôs disinterest, slides with practiced ease to her hip, tapping idly against the soft fabric of her kaftan. Her gaze, dark and sharp, flits between them all, taking  in the subtle shifts, the way Trippy falters, the way Imhra watches, the way Rook grins through it all. There‚Äôs something delicious in the tension of new company, the unknown edges waiting to be smoothed or frayed.

She lets the moment stretch just long enough to taste it, then steps forward with effortless grace, an amused smirk playing at her lips. 

&gt; &quot;Yes, let‚Äôs,&quot; she purrs, sweeping a hand toward the heavy doors. &quot;Before the air grows cold and the mystery dissipates. I do hate to keep a secret waiting.&quot;

<em>The companions had been speaking well out of earshot of the guards, but must certainly be thinking of what to say on approach. Quarin, Ailluin, and Imhra size these two up.

The woman is the first to notice the group finally approaching, and leans over to whisper to the man. The man nods, and pulls the knocker on the door behind him twice. Some fifteen second pass as the group concludes their approach--by which point the door has not been opened--whereupon the guardswoman speaks.</em>

Barovia is proving immensely unbalancing and it seems she has hit some sort of limit for personal change, at least temporarily. Too many challenges have presented themselves in these past several days and, you see, her brain has always been a bit strange after a near-fatal encounter with an Illithid nearly a century and a half ago.&quot;

<em>She looks beseechingly to Rook and, as she does so she notices something odd. She can tell that Rook has seen it, too. Hoping to make a connection with this delightful person, she cranes up toward Rook, and whispers,</em>

&quot;Oh, I&#x27;m sorry -&quot; *but there she goes again, introducing herself to the guards and dropping a name that, of all, Rook did not expect.

She hangs back a little, sidling up first to Qarin, then to Imrah, offering a small helpless shrug. When she has either of their attention, however, she shifts her gaze sharply towards the watching crow.*</span>

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><em>Imhra is surprised when Ailluin merely saying he isn&#x27;t familiar with registration is enough to bypass not only the request for it in the first place, but also the need for introductions at all. It&#x27;s convenient in this circumstance. Less convenient that she still doesn&#x27;t know where he (and potentially his kin) hail from. Which means there&#x27;s still a chance, however slim, that she coincidentally chooses an inconvenient lie.</em>

<em>She shoots a look at Qarin and Rook, and finds Rook at her side subtly directing her gaze to a crow. When she finds what Rook is looking at, she gives the bird a little smile and inclines her head, in a respectful &#x27;I see you&#x27; gesture. No way to be sure it is familiar or a Druid or anything other than just a bird, but regardless it doesn&#x27;t hurt to err on the side of being polite. Not to mention showing she isn&#x27;t easily fooled.</em>

<em>She turns back towards the door which is now open to them, but lingers to listen in on Rook&#x27;s conversation with the guard. She keeps that ghost of a smile on her face--her eyes still forward as she eavesdrops--amused at the way Rook&#x27;s demeanor shifts for the guard. The fact it tends to work so well--that rankles her a bit--but it <strong>does</strong> seem to work, and she can appreciate the art of it.</em></span>

If they are to receive help of any meaningful kind, it will be from Wachter herself.

As she traverses this distance, she is entirely focused on <strong>being</strong> a mere flicker of grey shades, as unobtrusive as the slow swirl of dust within a shaft of sunlight. If anyone with telepathy-like abilities were monitoring her surface-level thoughts during these few seconds, they would have found themselves immersed in deepest shadow, with scattered, barely noticeable pinpricks of light winking in and out of existence in their peripheral vision. Once stationary, Trpytivy cautiously directs her slightly cloudy, silver eyes back toward the open entrance, checking for any signs of corvid activity.

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Qarin stands between Imhra and Rook and observes. Taking in the situation. The people. The place. <em>The creepiness.</em>. 

Then as the guards speak they gather her attention, the nonsense about registration is nothing but a test, she concludes. An obstacle to either trip them up or catagorize them. Does this Lady Wachter even have the power to demand such things? 

Reaching out to touch both Rook and Imhra on their elbows, small gestures of connection rather than trying to grab their attention, Qarin studies the guards. There is power in the things you learn if you know to watch and observe. Such as the guardswoman, with her sharp-edged voice and a touch of bitter satisfaction, is a soul embittered by her own limitations.  The smugness in her words is a mask, and Qarin knows masks, for envy, and underneath that, fear. She needs them to fail. Because if they can succeed, then she has wasted her own chances.  

Qarin smiles. Envy and fear. Excellent hooks.

She hangs back as Trippy, in a mass of quicksilver words and shifting tongues, tries to gain access.  Qarin listens with one ear, cataloging the response, the layering of names and titles, and the deliberate weight of them.  An odd woman. But below the flustered babbling, she is more competent that she lets on. 

Ailluin is a study in contrast. Where Trippy weaves, he strikes. He flings his title like it is a banner at a jousting tournament, superiority in his tone. It might be simple Eladrin hauteur, since his presentation is grand. <em>The Last Ranger of the Silver Root.</em> Qarin smiles to herself and wonders iddly he is the last by tragedy or by failure? With his pride there will surely be proud declarations at some later time.</span>

She gazes back, lets the shape and weight of it press against her mind. An omen. Of what, she cannot yet say. The threads of meaning have not yet tangled into a shape she can see. But she still acknowledges it with a slow blink. Mysticism is, after all, a conversation with the unknown.  

As they move past the guards and into the manor Qarin turns her head to the guardswoman, her voice a low, knowing murmur meant for the woman‚Äôs ears alone.  

&gt; <em>&quot;You feel it, don‚Äôt you? That your story isn‚Äôt written as you would have it. That fate has miscast you.&quot;</em> A step forward, but her words still reach back. <em>&quot;It </em>isn‚Äôt<em> set in stone. You could still change it. I can read it for you.&quot;</em>  

A hook, subtle but there. Not just an offer, but a thread of possibility to be pulled.  

She moves onward, sweeping into the manor, a critical eye taking in the details as they waits for Lady Wachter, her shoulder against Imhra&#x27;s arm and a hand lingering near Rook&#x27;s.</span>

<em>All this flashes through her mind in the half-second she spends bowed before the lady and then, rising, she speaks as precisely as possible, if without the gravitas she had used with the dimwitted guards.</em></span>

She intentionally clasps her hands neatly in front of her, letting the cloak part so that the woman can see she holds no weapons in them. It also shows her green gown that matches her cloak, and the leather kirtle cut to flow with her dress--functional as armor but with pains taken to make it blend with her fine clothing.

&quot;This book will no more bind you to a purpose than any note that you may write. You will notice, of course, that we look to chronicle our citizens&#x27; commitment to Vallaki within these pages. That is its purpose, I suppose, to protect this fair city. And I have found that people are more likely to follow through on their commitments when they write them out, as you are doing. But no, there is nothing nefarious, or dare I say magical, about its pages.&quot;

<em>She glances out of the window, through which lake air wafts just as that moment.</em>

&quot;Now, to business. In the matter of protecting Vallaki, I am put into a difficult position. There is a rogue element that has holed up on an island on Lake Zarovich, and they are responsible for this &#x27;sunlight&#x27;. I need for this to be handled. And, of course, I will pay you for success handsomely, especially given the risks.&quot;

<em>All of her words, from start to finish, wrap and wind their way through the adventurer&#x27;s ears and about their minds. They are listening to a competent administrator, one who cares deeply about her town and its denizens. And she is truthful about the ledger and its &#x27;purpose&#x27;--or lack thereof--that no reason to not sign reminds in their minds. Sign, depart, disperse the sunlight and its source.</em>

<em>Yet between the words, Trippy notices things that aren&#x27;t said. To her ears, Lady Wachter <span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> <span class="spoiler-text">is ill at ease making this request of adventurers whom she does not know and trust. She does not like not knowing the provenance of the sunlight, and she was rather vague about this &#x27;rogue element&#x27;, suggesting that she does not have even an inkling of who might be responsible. But most of all, she hates that just by making this request, she may be showing her hand, and knowledge of this faux pas might reach her rivals and enemies</span></span>.</em></span>

Idly, she wonders how much the collection would gain, piecemeal, and how it&#x27;d translate in better gear for her guards, or even just a little extra vibrancy to the garden. But this is the dragoness lair, and it seems she likes it pretty and impressive and undisturbed.

She watches Tryppy and Ailluin approach and sign in good order, despite the initial, and quite useful, faux pas. By unspoken agreement with her companions, she moves a touch to the side. He half-bow could have been plucked from the high ballrooms of the Moonsea, and her diction slips to an accent a touch closer to the Lady&#x27;s, but carefully toeing the line between mirroring and obsequeince.*

&quot;I am simply Rook, lady Wachter. I couldn&#x27;t help but admire your collection.&quot; <em>She encompasses the heavy bookshelves with a roll of the wrist and an only slightly exaggerated note of awe at the end.</em> &quot;Is this rogue element known to Vallaki? We are new to these lands, but to even dare to mock the sun seems quite... bold, perhaps.&quot; <em>She leans over and regards the drying ink of Ailluin&#x27;s form, appreciating the calligraphy.</em> &quot;You also mentioned, ah, protection, should anything ill befall us? What would that entail, if I may?&quot;</span>

<em>She flashes the remaining two badges, but does not yet hand them to Rook or Qarin.</em>

&quot;As for direct assistance on this specific endeavor: these same shields will earn you the services of any boat that you wish to charter, and--within limit--the assistance of my guards. Mind, the guards are to protect Vallaki, and I do not take their losses lightly. In fact, three off duty guards were lost just two days ago, ambushed by sea creatures of some sort. I have it on good authority that the sea witches responsible have been dealt with, but that does not mean there are not more such. I cannot arm you better against such things than you can yourselves.&quot;

<em>Lady Wachter stands and begins to pace in the space behind her desk.</em>

&quot;As you must be new to Barovia, I will explain a circumstance. The skies of Barovia are a permanently enclouded fixture, and sunlight does not--has not--graced these lands since time immemorial. There are creatures here,&quot;  <em>she makes eye contact with Trippy,</em>  &quot;who do not want sunlight, and who would kill indiscriminately to ensure it does not appear. I do not want to see Vallaki subjected to such an event.&quot;

&quot;Were you to elect to live within the borders of Vallaki, you would be subject to fair taxation, and thus would need to have papers proving that you have legal standing to do so--provided, in fact, by the tax agents themselves. That is of little relevance. These Shields will, for your purposes, be even more effective, as they inform the citizens that you are <em>protectors</em> of Vallaki, and thus of high standing and regard.&quot;

&quot;As for the creatures on the island: a rather impressive armor--allegedly worn by the demon--made of pure platinum, was recovered and brought to the market. I had occasion to see it myself before the artisans who smelted it down confirmed its purity. Whatever dangers you will encounter, I expect them to be similarly real.&quot;

&quot;As for payment--you mistake me. I merely want to caution you of danger in this endeavor. While your kinfolk would be compensated in the event of your failure, <em>you</em> will be rewarded, both with good coin and my favor, should you succeed.&quot;

<em>Lady Wachter hands over the remaining two badges.</em>

&quot;I will ask that you keep the details of this discussion private, though you may of course need to share the broad strokes in the course of your investigation. Now, have you any other questions that I can answer?&quot;</span>

Then again, the new sword at her hip, commissioned for no more than a particularly fancy hilt and scabbard, is of such fashion and magic as she&#x27;s never quite seen before.

One step at a time, then. If anything, such spoils, even split evenly, would sort her partners and her own money problems for a while.*

<em>She is equally surprised by what she views as an unusually rapid display of trust from Lady Wachter. Which is either carelessness, or the act of a woman who has so little to fear that this sort of trust is cheap. Imhra is pretty sure it&#x27;s the latter.</em>

She takes a little longer than necessary to do so, still pondering. But she&#x27;s drawn from her thoughts by Rook&#x27;s request, and she looks up and ghosts a smile at the other woman, as she takes the badge from her. She undoes the pin with agile fingers and catches up the cloth of Rook&#x27;s lapel so she won&#x27;t accidentally poke her.</em>

&quot;And for our return? Will they wait for us, or should we build a bit of a bonfire?&quot;</span>

&quot;It is a pleasure to have the services of such conscientious persons as yourselves.

&quot;Are we then ready to what awaits us on this island?&quot; She asks the others. Though she has found no fault with Lady Wachter&#x27;s actions or words, something about the whole situation sets her a little on edge, as if the currents of something unseen or unspoken are sweeping her by without letting her in on their secrets.

&gt;     &quot;As she mentioned to Rook, she grew up in the Underdark and had many encounters with Mind Flayers. In fact, this is one of the reasons she is so skittish about lake travel. In the Underdark, one does <strong><em>not</strong></em> venture into, onto, or or otherwise near a body of water larger than a puddle unless one knows it very well or one is in quite desperate straits, indeed, for it poses tremendous risks. On the one hand, the waters in the Underdark are the domain of the Aboleth, and you do not wish to encounter them, even if you have numbers on your side, unless you are <em>magnificently</em> powerful. On the other hand, even an individual taking a quick dip to clean off the rock dust after a day of mining is inviting an Illithid tadpole to take up residence in one&#x27;s head to feast on one&#x27;s brain. She knows this is a vanishingly remote possibility, here, but, in her experience, unfamiliar waters hold unfathomable dangers.
&gt;     &quot;But she digresses. Somewhat. The answer to your question is that she grew up learning to use her senses other than sight to be aware of the ever-present dangers of the <em>Deep Dark</em>. For example, the Illithids have tremendous psionic powers that they used to hunt her clan from several hundred individuals down to just one. She is the only one who remains, the last of her extended family who, in turn, were the only survivors of Blingdenstone after the assault of the Drow.&quot;</span>

But they have a command of total magical darkness, which is a terrifying threat in battle. They would sneak up on us and wait until we were finished our work day, drop their darkness on us, and then slaughter as many of us as they could before making off with our haul of gems. It is this that inspired her to learn to see while blind. Her ability is quite limited‚Äîonly about 6 of her little paces. But it proved the only satisfactory counter to both the <em>darkness</em> of the Drow and the psionic powers of the Illithids.
&gt;     &quot;It is most effective when she knows how her allies move, and she does not know her current allies. She is learning how all of you move. But, equally, she does not know what we will face on the island. Will the light <em>blind</em> us? Or might there be unseen threats in the lake that she can respond to just before they emerge through the surface? If so, she must be ready. So she is practicing.
&gt;     &quot;You see, she is soft, now. Once she even had such command of shadow that she could produce the same darkness employed by the Drow. But she spent too many years in the Overbright and forgot most of the skills and abilities she worked so hard to learn simply to survive each day in the Deep Below. Barovia has taught her in two short weeks that she must re-gain her former strength and never again lose it.&quot;</div></span>

<em>And that final is the one that she catches on, viewing it with awareness that still pains her. She is not at all sure that is who she wants to be, here. Now. A chance to make a choice. A chance to thrive by that choice ... or choke on it.</em>

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">*The off-handed casualness with which Trippy - T≈ôpytiv√Ω, rather - mentions the horrible fate of her family, twice over, summons a surge of instinctual pity and suspicion just under Rook&#x27;s skin, for all her face and throat do all the right sounds and motions to keep a speaker buoyed. Not that the gnome seems to need it. 

Pity and suspicion, she strangles both, although she does seek cues from both Imhra and Qarin. As unfathomable as outpouring her own past feels, this land of Barovia takes all kinds into its decadence. And people cope differently. Besides, gnomes can appear deceptively young, not unlike elves. Would time soothe the hurts that still feel so keen and raw, decades on?*

<em>Her lips curl with a touch of sadness, though whether it&#x27;s for T≈ôpytiv√Ω&#x27;s story or Imhra&#x27;s answer, who is to guess?</em>

&quot;Names carry the echoes of those who named us, T≈ôpytiv√Ω.&quot; <em>Her tongue curls around the name, dipping briefly into Undercommon, before returning to the surface.</em> &quot;It&#x27;s a lovely name, to have and to have had. Your family must have cherished you.&quot; <em>Her words are kind, for all she&#x27;s not really smiling. Her hand on Imhra&#x27;s forearm fives the lightest squeeze</em> &quot;But ambassador and an investigator, you say. Was it at the same time, or did one lead into the other?&quot;</span>

She needed coin, so she used her skills to seek answers the Overbright&#x27;s denizens had not the stomach to find for themselves. She was really not a good investigator. She is good at observing, not finding, so answers took a long time to procure. But she was useful to law enforcement, and so she gained a reputation and the trust of those with power.
&gt;    &quot;Thus when she heard of some Svirfneblin refugees who had found their way to the surface and were being rejected by the Overbright cities, she used what influence she had to fight for them. This continued for many years and, eventually, she became a representative for many displaced peoples, not just the Deep Gnomes. She was not especially good at that, either, but when no one else would speak for them, she knew she had to.&quot;</div></span>

Truthfully, whatever expectations of &#x27;harbor&#x27; the adventurers might have had are shattered. A single dock extends into the water, its boards visibly damaged and likely unsafe to traverse. Moored to it are a sloop with its two sails, and a longboat--though a rather short one, with only six oars. Both of these would likely require crew to operate, beyond merely the skills of the adventurers. There are several commoners lazing on the rocky shore, three of which have simple small fishing boats. These might be sufficiently small as to be borrowed without the need for their owners to come along on the journey, but are also certain to be slower.</em></span>

But beneath the joke and easy smile, the unease and worry is threatening to obliterate her normally carefree attitude to life. She has not just stumbled into a land perpetually shrouded in gloominess and mist. She has been trapped here. And <em>that</em> realization is a bitter fruit to eat. It opens up for many questions that she has previously avoided looking too hard at. <em><span class="pre pre-inline">Oh mysterious one, your gifts are starting to feel like barbed arrows lodged in my chest.</span></em>

Outwardly the carefree smile never falters. <em>The show must go on.</em> She looks at their choice of transportation and is utterly lost. There is nothing familiar about one or the other, though she does suppose she could man an oar if push came to shove. Not well, but at least enough to create momentum.

&quot;Now, pray tell <em>sul&#x27;iel</em>, are you going to charm the crew to lend us their ship and time? Because in such case I have to watch closely.&quot; Qarin says with a smile.</span>

*The state of Vallaki&#x27;s streets and the layers of its inhabitants twist a few familiar knots in her guts, and she has to bite her lower lip at some of the more dismissive slights.  She knows it will paint a target on her back from the desperate and the few shamed one besides, but to walk away from cruelty is to be part of it, and Barovia is such a place to shove it down your throat until you don&#x27;t feel the taste.

As the cobblestones try to trip her, she unhooks her arm from Imhra&#x27;s elbow and loosens the strings of the silvers&#x27; pouch - light, and bait for cutpurses. She presses a silver into one, then another outstretched hand, and gauges the ones who clutch it and the ones who linger on the silver she&#x27;s passed onto others more. With the latter, she puts a little more pressure on the coin, a little edge to the smile she&#x27;s mustered before misery, a little menace to the shake of her head.*

<em>Practice doesn&#x27;t make it any less tiring, and she&#x27;s passed through that gate too often to delude herself there won&#x27;t be consequences. Better than starving.

It is quite a wonder to watch a woman spin her charm as deftly as Imhra does. That the young boy is caught in the strands is no surprise, young people have a lot to learn, including the wiles of women. Qarin chuckles at the sentence. 

She pulls out a holy symbol from its habitual place under her kaftan, nestled with the others. It is a small one, an eye surrounded by stars, seemingly carved out of wood. 

&quot;The moon goddess favors the water this day, so I too shall join.&quot; she says to the man, with a slow, breathy voice. &quot;So favored can only be a fortune for your beautiful ship.&quot; The symbol falls to her chest and she takes out the shield given to her by the Lady.  &quot;Is this not lending us enough credence, sir?&quot;</span>

&gt; &quot;By the Earthcaller&#x27;s hairy balls and the grace of Smoothhands, may the <strong>stank</strong> be steady as stone &#x27;neath her feet this day.&quot;

<em>At the completion of this prayer, her steps immediately grow surer. Trippy comes to stand amidst the three much taller ladies, facing the older fisher and clearing her throat. As she does so, she gives a slight, swift tug to the waistline fabric of her martial artist&#x27;s garb with her right hand, and the Shield of Vallaki flies out to her waiting left hand from the folds where she had earlier secreted it‚Äîflashily‚Äîfor the Baroness.</em>

He is exquisite in combat should the need for such skills arise and his dextrousness will doubtless be of value should the waters grow choppy. As you see, he is quite stalwart, though a person of few words. He will speak further for himself if he wishes.&quot;

She briefly places a reassuring hand on Trippy&#x27;s shoulder, before turning her attention back toward the ship, confidence and serenity radiating from her stance.</span>

She sets her oversized pack at her feet. Anyone who had looked at it carefully would have noticed that the upper third or so of it was quite bulbous‚Äîalmost hemisphere-shaped. While Imhra begins making some inquiries of the fishers, rather than sitting, Trippy opens the top of her pack and reaches both arms in, one on each side. Trippy clamps the pack between her knees to hold it in place and begins tugging on something, seemingly attempting to leverage it out. She rocks her torso side to side, straining slightly. Suddenly, she tumbles onto her bottom, and the pack falls to one side. She does a complete backward summersault, coming to rest in a seated position, her arms wrapped around something quite unusual.</em>

<em>Hopping to her feet, Trippy walks over to her pack, and sits with the strange object in her lap. She laces up her pack and then wiggles a little to get comfortable. She spends several seconds looking down at a ruggedly constructed copper and brass face mask with thick fabric straps that buckle behind the head and neck. The glass front is curved and smooth from the nose up. A separate glass chamber at mouth level seems to have something slightly cloudy dancing inside. Anyone with experience in elemental magics would recognize that a tiny air elemental swirls within. She grins impishly for a few seconds as she regards this curious wonder of artifice before a serene look comes over her face and she closes her eyes.</em></span>

She eyes the rippling waters as the anchor goes overboard and silently measures the spans of rope or chain that snake and snap after the heavy iron into the depths. Twenty to twenty five feet. A lot can hide in there. And one can drown in anything as shallow as a puddle.*

&quot;A good one for a dip as well, <strong>fenorain</strong>?&quot; *she asks Qarin, amusement rolling in her fricatives. She secures her birdpipes in a waterproof satchel with her bowstrings and leans her unstrung bow near the bulwark, then sits there to silently assist Ailluin with his shot.

The arrow flies true, but, well...*

&quot;It was a good idea,&quot; <em>she concedes, not lying. She wraps her cloak around the length of curved bow, ties her bramble-hair in a quick braid, then with a smile bracketing a blade held between her teeth, plunges into the waters boots first.</em>

<em>Glancing briefly at Imhra, T≈ôpytiv√Ω&#x27;s look is so steely that it could be mistaken for Ailluin&#x27;s chilling gaze. She places the bronze, copper, and glass mask over her face and buckles the leather straps tightly around the back of her head and neck. As she inhales her first breath, the tiny elemental is pulled toward her mouth, rebounding to fill the chamber when she exhales. Trippy then kneels to put the straps of her pack over her shoulders, and opens two small pockets on each side to pull out straps that she buckles snugly around her chest and just above her hips. Standing, she pulls the mask away from her mouth slightly and speaks to Imhra out of the corner of her mouth.</em>

&gt; &quot;She cannot speak when she wears the bubble, but that will shortly be irrelevant, as you will see. Normally, she carries slightly less than twice her weight in her pack but, while you, Rook, and Qarin opened negotiations with the fishers, she put several large, heavy rocks in it. So now...&quot;

<em>With her right hand, T≈ôpytiv√Ω presses the mask firmly back against her face. With her left hand, she releases the clasp that keeps her shortsword in its sheath. She turns so she is directly facing the island and, keeping her left hand on the sword hilt, she hops over the side of the boat, plunging into the water. She sinks steadily to the bottom, drawing her sword as she does so. When her feet touch down, her small silhouette is faintly visible through the murk of the water in the faint moonlight glow of her enchanted blade.</em></div></span>

She thrusts the glowing blade at a shadowy form but she misses, and is then horrified to realize she has just tried to stab Imhra! She corrects her internal targeting and attempts to lash out at the shark with her right fist.

She forgets which way is up and, as she falls onto her back, she barely keeps hold of her sword&#x27;s hilt.</em>

Qarin has to struggle to not scream in pain and panic as she sees the surface, dark and gloomy grow smaller and smaller as she is being dragged below by the harpoon in her thigh. She can&#x27;t scream. She can&#x27;t. She will lose all her air. 

<em>Mysterious one.. help me. I can&#x27;t die here. That would be a waste. Surely!</em> 

But the healing energy that envelops her is not the one of the Mysterious one. Its flavor is the fragrance of flowers and tea. Her heart warms in response. <em>Imhra</em>

Bolstered she finds the dagger at her side and slashes at the arm of the merman dragging her down. He loosens his grip and she manages to fight her way up and closer to land. 

It worries her how red the water is around her. How weak she feels even with Imhra&#x27;s healing magic supporting her. <em>You cannot help anyone if you lie dead at the bottom of this lake, Cali. You have to survive.</em>

And though she don&#x27;t want to let in the murky water, she grasps for the connection, tenuous and ephemeral as it is, to her god and she whispers <em>Vaelor</em>. 

The magic pulls and nips at her wounds, the dark swirls of dusty grey and silver of her magic displacing the blood around her.</span>

She nearly launches herself off the shark, calling on her shadow for speed. But Imhra&#x27;s sweet note and the silver of Qarin&#x27;s healing push the bile back into her throat, and she cheers when her partner&#x27;s dagger flashes.</em>

*Sloppy of hers, getting distracted while tangling with a shark. The great beast buckles, dislodging one sword while the other remains buried deep. Rook goes cartwheeling back into the waves, head over heels, and tastes the lake and shark blood when the tail smashes into her back on the rebound. The jutting stone rushes for her face, like the ground when she messed a leap or a pirouette. It&#x27;s pure instinct to fold herself and twist, for all the water both slows her and maker her feel awkward. Her boots catch the slippery surface of the rock, and Rook <strong>pushes</strong>, rocketing towards the shark&#x27;s flank. Her sword, old trusted steel, slips into the shark&#x27;s flaring gills. Blood bursts out, near blinding her, but Rook braces on the hilt of her gearwork blade, and rides her momentum up the scaly side even as the predator shudders and goes limp.

The Barovian winds whip at her sodden, blood-drenched clothes and her face. Rook slips her blades free with a twisting wrench and like running on a tightrope, springs from one shark to the next. She soars over Alluin&#x27;s head and slams boots and blade-first into the other shark. Her blade sinks deep, shadows surging down the hilt and into the wound, before she kicks away, splashing near Imhra, wild-faced.*</span>

He bites down hard, his teeth against her collarbone. The crack of her clavicle is the last painful sensation she feels before the darkness grips her.</em>

&quot;Aim there lad! That&#x27;s the one... FIRE!&quot;

<em>Those above the water head the father&#x27;s call. Back on the sloop, he and his son have set up a makeshift ballista--a heavy crossbow fitted with a tripod, restrung with a winch that would clearly take two people to operate. And luckily for the adventurers, the father has the son helping.</em>

<em>The thrumm of the device is visceral. The bolt from it flies with such force that the water near Qarin and her merman veritably explodes. The projectile lodges in the small of the merman&#x27;s back, piercing him through. The tip juts from his stomach, very likely a mortal wound--once the projectile is removed.</em></span>

It is as if she has to <strong>push</strong> with her senses but, when she does, the scene crystallizes before her and she is now in control. As the hand of her other deity recedes she offers a brief prayer of thanks. She kneels next to Qarin, withdrawing a handful of Shrooms, which she pushes into the unconscious woman&#x27;s mouth.

And then it is darkness. And she is floating. Sinking. Flying. Weightless. 

Until her mouth is filled with the flavor of nutty, earthy taste of mushrooms, tempered with brackish water. Her eyes shoot open and her world is water, greyish red with clouds and blood. She sees the weird shape of Trippy, but her brain refuses her recognition. It knows only panic now. 

She stiffen and flails her arms, dragged down by her armor.  She gasps and swallows, heaves for air that is not there, kicks uselessly. She is so weak and her movements too chaotic to help her. 

And then there it is again, the flower and tea scent envelops her and immediately calms her rising panic. <em>Live!</em> her heart sings. She relaxes and then her body takes over, coordinating her ascent with strong strokes and kicks. 

With a fresh mouthful of air the panic and near deat turns to rage. <em>How dare they? She had done nothing to them and yet she has been drowned and killed and wounded.</em>
She pokes her head under the water and spots the merman, points her finger at him and with a small prayer to her mysterious one she opens her mouth, letting loose harsh words. 

[Deep Speech] &quot;<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> <span class="spoiler-text">Kh&#x27;vash Zgurath</span></span>&quot; and a dark grey and silver light sparks from her finger and borrows its way through the churning water, hitting the merman between his eyes.

She latches on, clings to them, hoping that no more harpoons are forthcoming.</span>

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">*The water tastes like shark blood. Her fingers tremble around the hilts of her swords from the cold. A shout lodges itself in her throat as Qarin goes limp, goes under, vanishes behind the explosion of water. 

<span class="pre pre-inline">Creators. Tricksters. Please, no. Please, let her be alive.</span>*

<em>Maybe they answer, because the next moment, Qarin breaks the surface, silver streaks, and it&#x27;s the merman who goes under, pulled down by the foot of metal in his guts and missing a head. A thread looped deep in her chest pulls Rook towards the shore as well, after Imhra&#x27;s bobbing shape of pooling skirts, her back exposed to -</em>

<strong><em>&quot;Falon&#x27;din, enasala enaste.&quot;</strong></em>

<em>Rook&#x27;s shadow snakes over her skin like climbers on a tree.</em>

&quot;Get &#x27;em to shore,&quot; *she says to Ailluin, then she&#x27;s off, moving faster then her leg kicks would warrant. Not straight, but down, towards the lakefloor. There she flips around, pushes <strong>harder</strong>, and rockets up to the merman and that hateful harpoon that is <strong>not</strong> going to hit anyone ever again.

The next few moments are a flurry of stabs. She feels the claws tear up her side, but Falon&#x27;Din&#x27;s blessing numbs the pain, the cold, the taste and smell of the merman&#x27;s blood. She feels it fade as the merman flees first, her blade raking down the length of his tail.*

&quot;Get back here!&quot; <em>she shouts after him, spitting bloodied water.</em></span>

<em>Only one assailant remains, but he can read the signs plain as day: stay, and die. Flee, and maybe return with reinforcements. Who would have thought that these fragile prey would put up such a fight?</em>

<em>Rook is right there, stabbing into him, and so he strikes back, sharp claws raking her side. And then he&#x27;s off, powerful fish tail propelling him away from this killing field. She tags him again, but he yet lives! And that is all that matters.</em>

&quot;Da, he&#x27;s getting away! I see him, I have a shot!&quot;  <em>the boy yells from the ship, swinging the ballista around. His father is very nearly dragged with it as he cranks the winch. Grab another bolt, slot it in. Lock it in place. Aim. Pull the trigger.</em>

<strong><em>THRUMMMM</strong> The bolt flies north, and plunges into the water after the merman. The hit is good! It catches him in the upper back, and Rook watches as the harpoon drops from the merman&#x27;s webbed hands and sinks to the lake bed below, while its wielder&#x27;s body contorts in death throes and then goes still.</em>

&quot;Is that all of them? Did you lot just fight off three sharks?!&quot;  <em>the man yells, counting the adventurers on his fingers to make sure all are alive.</em>  &quot;Good on you,&quot;  <em>he adds, putting his hand to his chest.</em>  &quot;The lad and I will keep vigil until dark, a few hours out.

It distracts her from the fact that Rook has turned back towards the remaining Merman. For her part, the bard in the gown and cloak is really struggling to stay above water now, and when she tries to call out to Rook she opens her mouth just as she sinks a bit and water surges and gets a mouthful of lake water to choke on.</em>

<em>If she stays in the water, she will drown. She feels a surge of guilt as she sheathes the dagger back into its hiding place in her lute, turns and swims towards the shore, fighting with her cloak as it threatens to entangle her and drag her to the bottom. She stands as soon as her feet can touch the bottom and slogs her way out, looking like a sea creature emerging from the deep. The waves in her long hair are dragged straight by the weight of the water and she is coughing as she finally gets herself onto the rocky shore. As soon as she is on solid ground, she stands dripping with her face to the lake, looking for Qarin, for Rook, for the little Gnome, and for the Eladrin. Her mind is racing through her repertoire for a song that will bring them all safely to shore.</em></span>

She crawls up until her feet no longer touch the water, shrugs off her backpack and then falls to her knees as she makes a mental headcount of her companions. 
Ailluin and Trippy are looking a little battered, but okay. She eyes the contraption that Trippy is taking off and realizes that this is what she saw in the lake. She owes the little woman a huge debt of gratitude for her life. 
Her heart soars when she sees Imhra bedraggled and wounded, but alive. Her nose fills with the scent of her magic. She wants to go to her, hug her. Kiss her and not ever let her go again. But her legs are dead logs under her and she needs a little rest. <em>Love can come a little later.</em> 

Her eyes sweep the beach again and realize that Rook isn&#x27;t there yet. She curses her dead-log-legs and twists her upper body around to scan the water. And, luckily <em>there</em>! Rook, a speck of dark in the water, swimming to land. 

<em>Thank you, oh mysterious one. Thank you.</em> she thinks into the nothingness. <em>If I was meant to die here, I will gladly do so for them.</em> 

She is being a little melodramatic she knows. But nearly dying should allow a woman some leeway in that department. She chuckles a little to herself and then curls up in the sand and closes her eyes for a little while.</span>

When she re-emerges, her clockwork blade has a fresh coating of merman viscera, and the body is missing half its throat and gills.

No more chances. No playing possum.

She fights down the bone-deep urge to make for the shore, to make <strong>sure</strong> her eyes are not deceiving her. But kindness calls for kindness and gratitude, so she sheathes her blades and with long strokes, makes for the fishermen&#x27;s boat and her wrapped-up bow, bopping against the hull.

She hauls herself up until her elbows rest on the bulwark. Between her blood, the shivering, her plastered curls, and how tendrils of her shadow writhe across her face and hands like tattoos, she must look quite she sight. But between heaving breaths, her voice drips with gratitude.*

<em>If that bolt had not taken Qarin&#x27;s attacker...</em>

&quot;Thank you. Both of you. If the lady&#x27;s reward does not cover your debt, or anything else, I will.&quot;

*She waits a moment to let it sink in, then kicks away from the hull, grabs the floating bundle, and speeds for shore until her legs burn. She half-crawls, half-scrambles up the steep bank, throwing the bundle above the line of the surf before sweeping Imhra in a one-armed hug and pressing her forehead into her shoulder. Brief and sudden, to make sure she&#x27;s real. The magic of Imhra&#x27;s music still buzzes on her lip and under her skin, but. But. 

She doesn&#x27;t squeeze, to avoid aggravating any wounds, but it&#x27;s a close, close thing.*

&quot;You are shivering,&quot; <em>she says, through her chattering teeth. Part of her blouse and armor hangs in tatters, but underneath, her shadow is already stitching the gouges together, sealing them with inky blackness. In fact, Rook is projecting no shadow on the shingle.</em></span>

<em>Still, self-discipline has its limits, especially when it comes to her partners. Rook slips a hand down around Imhra&#x27;s wrist and tugs her towards Qarin, sitting in the shingle, equally covered in blood, her silks and her armor and the puckered, scabbed skin underneath...</em>

Then she looks at Trippy, goes to kneel in front of her to be at eye level.</em> 

&quot;Thank you for helping my friend.&quot; <em>She says, pouring all the earnestness she has to offer into the words.

<em>She takes her lute off her back, adjusts the tuning peg that she&#x27;d withdrawn a dagger from to make up for knocking the string a bit out of tune in the process. She starts to sing, a Sylvan lullaby--she had toyed with the idea of doing something in Undercommon as a gift of sorts to Trippy, but she isn&#x27;t certain how that will be received. Better to be safe. It&#x27;s a song of home and hearth, and the sounds of her voice weaves magic as it slowly weaves through the clothing of anyone near her and drives out the water and its chill.</em>

<em>She doesn&#x27;t look at Rook or Qarin because the music is less likely to do its duty if her voice wavers.</em></span>

&gt;     &quot;She is so happy Qarin is well, that we all are. She did what she could. It was less than she would have liked.&quot;

<em>A few seconds later, seated on her pack communing with her gods, T≈ôpyt√≠vy had felt that the thread of puissance sustaining her bond with them had been ever so tenuous here in Barovia. Yet now, on this beach and surrounded by freezing, deadly waters, she felt the not only the presence of her four companions but something much greater. She sought the source of it.</em>

<em>Imhra stood close by, a shifting shadow wrapped tightly around vibrant colours desperate to burst forth. The music she played soothed them all, but also <strong>elevated</strong> Trippy&#x27;s soul <strong>closer</strong> to the Svirfneblin deities.</em>

<em>She smiled warmly now, not even knowing she did so. The bond with Segojan Earthcaller and Callarduran Smoothhands <strong>had</strong> grown stronger this day. This drew her attention to Qarin. Here T≈ôpyt√≠vy found a much less tightly woven veil of muted colours lit from within by rapidly cycling radiance of white, silver, and gold.</em>

<em>Between these two, it was almost possible to miss Rook, but Trippy could not lose sight of this one, for she was so changed from the bewildered creature in the Barovia Village square of only two days ago. Reaching her awareness out to Rook, Trippy had found... something very like the stone foundation so characteristic of her own kin: smooth and beautifully irregular, anchoring the other two yet ready to fit into the many unusual spaces they create around themselves simply by existing. Trippy saw Rook was this stable core, not wanting to be found out and so almost invisible below a writhing, beguiling blanket of midnight inky wisps‚Äîthousands upon thousands of them.</em></span>

They reached down to her and showed her what was needed. They said you were worth saving. She would have done so anyway, but now she understands that the firm footing they provide is there to help her reach for mystery. She will appreciate your Mysterious One, now. Thank you for helping her to see.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Qarin finally gets up from her kneeling position. She stumbles a little as her legs regain some blood and feeling starts tingling in her feet. She deliberately avoids looking down at her once-beautiful clothing, now torn and ripped and forever stained. Such irrelevancies sting a little less in the face of near death. 

She moves to Imhra and Rook, wrapping her arms around them tenderly. &quot;I am so glad you are okay. I am sorry. I saw the dangers and I was foolish. I was naive and thought the water was not our destination. I gambled with your lives in my ignorance and arrogance and I am sorry. I will not make the same mistake again.&quot;

Then she puts her forehead against Imhra&#x27;s. &quot;Sun&#x27;iel. Without you and Trippy, I would not be alive.  I don&#x27;t know how to repay you except to return the favor if ever necessary. I hope not.&quot; She squeezes Imhra&#x27;s hand and presses a kiss on her cheek. Not enough. But.. it will have to do. 

Letting her lovers go, she gets down on her knees in front of Trippy. Not in a show of deference, but simply to get to a more equal height. 

&quot;Trippy. I will forever be in your debt. Thank you for saving my life. I am sorry I got us into this situation by not speaking up when I should have. It will not happen again.&quot; She takes Trippy&#x27;s hand and squeezes it. 

Then, after Trippy&#x27;s declaration she squeezes it again. &quot;No need to thank me, Trippy. My Mysterious one will lend you their magic if you ever need it.  Its mysteries as well, should you feel called to it.&quot;</span>

&quot;I am here to offer my apology. I got us into this mess knowingly and, though it was not with malice, I am sorry. I should have warned of the creatures in the water and yet I did not. I have no excuse except miscalculation. It will not happen again.&quot;

Unsure how one shows gratitude to an Eladrin, she offers her hand, like she did in front of the mansion only an hour or two earlier.</span>

She rests her chin on her shoulder as the freezing heaviness of the water lightens and drifts away, and after a few moments of listening, picks up Imhra&#x27;s Sylvan tune from her lover&#x27;s strumming in the early mornings. She weaves a lilting, rolling counter melody to the lullaby, letting the notes thrum from her chest into Imhra&#x27;s back.

‚ÄúYou ask what good is wisdom if it is not shared,‚Äù she echoes, eyes never leaving his. ‚ÄúAnd you are right to ask.‚Äù

She keeps her hand in his. ‚ÄúI saw the danger. And as I often do, I assumed wrong. Based on not enough reflection. I assumed that we would land on the beach and wholly avoid the water. A miscalculation and maybe a little too much trust in my luck and charm.. and the dramatic timing of the universe, though I at least should have dispelled any notion I have of the universe&#x27;s innocence.&quot; 

She pauses. ‚ÄúI told myself I was protecting them from needless worry.‚Äù

Over the past hour, the levity and connection with her fellow adventurers, in addition to her meditation, has made her feel much lighter on her feet than she has ever since discovering that the young guardswoman she had helped rescue a week ago had been bitten by a werewolf.</em>

<em>She signals to the group that she is going to scout ahead, and sneaks up the hill away from them. Every 60 paces or so [30&#x27;] she pauses to look quickly back over her shoulder. She intends to go as far as she can without them losing sight of her (thank the Earthcaller they aren&#x27;t in even non-magical darkness or she would be invisible to them already). However, her attention is almost entirely focused on observing her surroundings ahead and to each side. She breathes as little as possible and moves at half her normal speed. As soon as she feels like her companions will lose sight of her, she stops to process their situation, considering whether to beckon them forward or return to them.</em></span>

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><em>Would that this island were woods, Ailluin might have been in his element. Alas, between the massive boulders there are rocks, and amid those are pebbles, all in various shades of black and grey, with no greenery in sight. It is not a far stretch, armed with the rumor of a fissure higher up, to guess that the island and its rocks might be volcanic in nature.</em>

<em>And so it is Trippy who is the ideal explorer, as she is both easily camouflaged by her environment, and has sharp eyes--and other senses, honed by the underdark--that search for threats.</em>

<em>But no threats come, despite a mounting sense of ominous foreboding with each upward step. An hour, or perhaps less, remains until the &quot;light&quot; arrives, and with it whatever foul or divine or arcane magics that have beset the adventuring parties who came on previous days. Yet at present, the island is barren--of magics, of dangers, of life. Trippy&#x27;s eyes examine every crag that might house a threat, every darkened hollow that might be a tunnel of unknown dangers, every shift of the rocks or pebbles lest they herald a greater threat. For good or ill, none come to fruition.</em>

<em>When she reaches what must be the apex, from which she can still just barely make out her companions as specks on the rocky shore and the northbound boat&#x27;s sail as a tiny kite flapping in the wind, Trippy can also see that she has reached a sort of rocky rim. Ahead, a small caldera dips down, some hundred yards across, and in its very center is a dark gash. To her eyes, it looks as if a sword held by a titan was plunged into the prone body of Barovia eons ago, and what she sees now is the gaping wound left behind in the land&#x27;s unbreathing corpse upon the blade&#x27;s withdrawal.</em>

<em>No smoke billows from the fissure, nor lava pours from it. If it had been active, it would not have been in the past several years--let alone days prior, as another group of adventurers had claimed.</em></span>

<em>Qarin&#x27;s petting of Nutmeg and the way the little fellow - smarter than a quick glance might bely, for sure - draws fond exhasperation from someone as pondering and aloof as Ailluin infuse a few notes of genuine amusement to her singing. She tries to keep it up while Trpytivy sets off on her scouting mission into the barren, cracked volcanic hills, blending with the dead earth in a way that Rook, for all her expertise and tricks, wouldn&#x27;t quite manage. But Imhra&#x27;s music is making her drenched, torn clothes positively toasty, and there are few things as soothing to worry and pain as holding another and being held by their song.</em>

<em>The mission won&#x27;t be delayed too long, mixed blessing that it is. She lets go of Imhra, giving her a shrewd, mock-chastising look at her teasing touch. Then with reluctance, she draws each of her blades to check them, and unwraps her bow from where the dried cloak bundle rests. With a single, practiced motion, she steps into the curve of the bow, bends it around her thigh, and strings it. Calloused fingertips run through the fletching of her arrows - secured during the frantic moments in the lake by a crafty loop of leather bunding them together in the hip quiver.</em>

<em>She hums in agreement with Imhra, then turn to Qarin, cocking her head in a silent request about insight from the Mysterious One, before turning to Trpytivy .</em>

On of these days one or the other would fail. And where would that leave her? Where would it leave Rook and Imhra? Where would it leave this party? 

But, she closes her eyes and sends a prayer to the Mysterious One.

Had she said the words out loud she would have spun them with threads of desperation and supplication, with dramatic grandiosity, but in her internal voice is nothing but earnest need and begging.  

In reply she hears only laughter. 

She opens her eyes and smile, shaking out her torn, now dry, kaftan and scarf.

Had always hid them or made them part of her presence. But this ose ledges do not inspire any confidence in her ability to get to the bottom without falling to her death. Real death, this time.  <em>Would ropes make it easier for her?</em> Probably not.

She looks up into the gloomy sky. She could use some help. They all could. 

<em>Well.. what did she have to lose?</em>

She falls to her knees and lifts her hands to the clouds. 

&quot;Oh Mysterious one. I beseech you, oh holy one.

 Watch over us as we make our way to the bottom. Guide our way down and up again. Give us the courage to do what we must, the cunning to know what to do, the wisdom to know where to go. 

Oh benevolent one. Keep us in your sight and help us, so that we may succeed with our mission.&quot;

She casts her voice as if she was leading a mass prayer, her tone somber and voice vibrant. 

She keep her arms reaching for the sky even as her words run out, hardly blinking. Waiting for a sign or an answer. 

It comes just as she is about to give up. The laugh she expected, but the words she did not. 

<em>Yes child, I am watching.</em> a chill crackles down her spine. 

For the first time she is faced with the possibility... <em>certainty</em> that the laugh does not belong to <em>her</em> god. 

<em>Oh fuck!</em>

Externally her eyes twitching is the only outward sign of the disturbing nature of the answer. With a well practiced movement she tilts her head to the side, listening to the message relayed. 

When she is certain there is no further attempt at communication she folds her hands in her lap and opens her eyes. 

&quot;He will look over us.&quot; She says with supreme confidence. 

With a small smile she gets to her knees and moves to stand next to Rook. 

&quot;<strong>Will that make ascent easier?</strong>&quot;</span>

She plays in an idle sort of way that Qarin and Rook have had occasion to recognize as meaning she is plucking the strings of the weave as well as of the instrument. Sometimes she works her magic into a song she already knew--artfully placing the threads of the magic among the progression of notes as she sings and plays. And sometimes it&#x27;s a more focused affair--like now. It sounds like she&#x27;s holding an impromptu jam session with herself--a talented musician &#x27;just playing&#x27;. Magic has its own melody, so while it meanders there&#x27;s still a <strong>rightness</strong> to it that prevents it from seeming like she&#x27;s just idly picking at strings with no clue what she&#x27;s doing.</em>

<em>She watches and listens as Qarin beseeches her God for guidance, and catches that hint of discomfort. She makes a note to ask Qarin about it later, when the elusively bombastic woman can speak freely. For now, she trusts the woman will not deceive them into danger. <span class="pre pre-inline">Foolish</span> is the sulky comment from him, the memory of a man she&#x27;d purposefully left behind. She ignores him.</em>

<em>Finally she draws the music to a satisfying end, and puts her lute back over her shoulder. There&#x27;s a faint shimmer of magic over her eyes as she looks around. Her gaze lingers on one of the Vallaki shields and one eyebrow quirks. It is either a risky bit of magic to be giving out so freely--or the caster is powerful enough to set strong boundaries around its capabilities and applications.</em>

&quot;Thus far I see nothing magical around us that we did not bring in ourselves.&quot; <em>She says,</em> &quot;That is, at least, information ... how useful it is remains to be seen.&quot;

<em>She looks from Trippy to Rook,</em> &quot;This is not my area of expertise,&quot; <em>She says,</em> &quot;I am the product of dances and dinner parties and noble posturing in drawing rooms, so forgive me if this question is naive ...

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><em>Trippy scampers along the rim of the rift, finding a spot where she can fix a grappling hook to give ~120 feet of descent to a safe bottom-out spot for down-climbing, as well as with minimal rubbing of the rope on either the top lip of the rock or any jutting edges along the wall. She collects ropes from Rook and Ailluin. Working several feet from the rift edge so as not to drop anything, Trippy ties the end of the first hempen rope to the grappling hook using a bowline knot.</em>

<em>To connect the two hempen ropes, Trippy ties two back-to-back figure-8 knots about 1/2 foot from the bottom of the upper rope and then attaches the lower rope ~4 inches above these figure-8 knots using a rolling hitch knot. This ensures that the connection will remain secure since the downward tension on the knot will be parallel to the line of the top rope, with the two figure-8s providing backup in case the rolling hitch knot slides a little.</em></span>

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><em>Trippy ties the middle, hempen rope to the bottom, silk rope using a sheet bend knot‚Äîthe most secure way she knows to attach ropes of different sizes together. She chooses the silk rope as the bottom rope because she wants the bulk of the elasticity to be at the bottom. Any stretch at the top will be amplified further down, increasing the likelihood of lower knots loosening or of someone falling due to bounce in the rope.</em>

<em>She carefully places the grappling hook to ensure it is properly anchored near the selected spot at the rift lip, and tosses the rope over. From her pack, she produces a flag she had fished out of the lake that morning that the father-son duo had informed her was from a famous shipwreck (though likely a replica flag, not the real thing). She cuts several smaller rectangles from it and then folds it over a few times and places it under the upper rope where it hangs across the rough edge of the rim. She produces a small, iron hammer made by an ancient Dwarven clan, which she had also collected while fishing near Barovia village. (The lack of appreciable rust is surprising. It is not enchanted, but she suspects it was at one time, perhaps until very recently. She also believes it to be of Duergar origin based on some unique features of its craftsmanship.) Using the hammer, she drives two pitons through the folded-over flag to either side of the rope, to make sure the cushioning remains in place.</em>

<em>She folds the rectangles cut from the flag into makeshift pads and tucks them in one of her two belt pouches along with the iron hammer. Her remaining 8 pitons go in her other pouch.</em></span>

Then she replaces the hammer, untwists her right arm, and continues until she reaches the rock platform nearest the point ~5 ft. from the rope bottom. She slides the rope out from the loop on her belt, and awaits the next adventurer.</em></span>

She grabs hold of the rope and looks at it for a second, trying to convince herself that she can do whatever it is that Trippy just did.

It is punctuated with bumps, bruises, and scrapes for most of the adventurers. There are showers of pebbles and rock chips, some intentional and some not, as the natural ledges take--or rather, fail to take--the weight placed upon them. Imhra has by far the most difficulty, what with her mind focused on maintaining her extrasensory perception of magic, and thus not focused on not falling. Still, no one falls, and no injuries sustained are more than superficial.</em>

<em>Three rope lengths tied together turn out to exceed the length of the shaft, for it is some eighty feet down that Trippy reaches a cavern, with Qarin not far behind. For Quarin, the voice in her head--of someone who is decidedly <strong>not</strong> her god--echo which every ledge reached.</em>

<em>Imhra arrives at the tail end of her spell&#x27;s duration, and her arcane sight picks up the faint traces of necromancy and transmutation on a figure lying on the floor, and a small book, left opened but spine-up, lying nearby.</em>

<em>Imhra&#x27;s enhanced sight fades as Rook and Ailluin bring up the rear. although the diffuse Barovian &#x27;daylight&#x27; barely filters down the jagged shaft, such that the cavern is hard to see in darkvision notwithstanding, it is hard to miss certain features.</em>

<em>There is the supine figure, face down, and the face down opened book next to it. There is also a bedroll off by one wall, with what might have been a fire pit nearby. And, while the walls of the cavern are between forty and sixty feet away in every direction, there is blackness off in the distance to the northeast, as if that of a natural tunnel.</em></span>

Her cream, rumpled blouse and blood-stained pants darken and thicken into an embroidered uniform with golden wiverns at the lapels and shoulders, and her long fingers become encased in supple leather gloves, with the faint imprint of dragon scales.</em>

<em>Anyone from Faerun, or familiar with its premiere and most unscrupulous mercenary company, would recognize the uniform of the Zhentarim. And Rook&#x27;s grimace of distaste and sharp tug at the sleeves is equally unmistakeable.</em>

<em>She&#x27;s not far from Imhra throughout the descent, half-scampering half-slipping down with the rope looped around her ankle and palm, another foot bracing on the ravine&#x27;s wall. Once her feet touch the ground, the scuffed dragonhine gloves melt back into her previous attire. She draws the ironwood club from the small of her back, and at the word <strong>&quot;Fen&quot;</strong>, a sheen covers the smooth wood.</em>

<em>With her other hand, she fishes out a glowing rock from her belt, smoothed to a shine by the Barovian lake waters. Darkvision is all well and good, but colours can reveal much. After making sure Imhra is alright, she takes position behind and to Qarin&#x27;s side as she examines the body, casting about for threats and traps.</em></span>

<em>Her heart is pounding a little as she moves towards the light in Rook&#x27;s hand, using the cover of her long skirts to hide her careful movement and the way she gently sweeps the ground with each foot before she places it to make sure she&#x27;s not going to trip or fall into a hole or anything else equally undignified.

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><em>Feeling at home--or as at home one can feel in a place reminiscent of the underdark--Trippy moves with speed and stealth into the gloom. To the eyes of the others, despite Qarin&#x27;d blessing of night sight, the svirfneblin is indistinguishable from the darkness she moves through. Deeper to the northeast of the large cavern, Trippy finds a hollow that narrows as it turns. Around a corner she finds a large digging machine, composed of a massive conical drill mounted onto a housing, sat upon treads. Behind the drill is a blocked tunnel, likely dug by the machine itself, but it has since collapsed. The machine sits idle, a door open, with no one operating it.</em>

<em>Back in the main cavern, Qarin and Ailluin examine the body. Upon turning the head, Qarin finds that the face is that of a man&#x27;s, of indeterminate race. He is tall, taller even than an elf, with era longer and pointier than Ailluin and his kin. And he is definitely dead. Ailluin sees battle wounds: slashes and stabs, as if with swords, that have rent this man&#x27;s clothing and the flesh underneath. Whatever happened here, it was most certainly violent. Rook&#x27;s instinct--to strike the corpse should it move--does not bear immediate fruit, and so her stress continues to build in apprehensive anticipation.</em>

<em>Imhra finda herself drawn to the recently magicced book. Her instincts battle each other. On the one hand, this book may have an answer to what the source of the sunlight it, or else rituals, spells, or other secrets worth discovering. On the other, the encorcelement upon it may summon an eldritch horror when touched, or consume the reader&#x27;s soul, or fill the chamber with lava. Unfortunately for Imhra, nothing on the cover nor spine stands out as indicative of one or the other.</em>

<em>For those keeping time, the appointed arrival of the light--or whatever else is due to come--is due any minute.</em></span>

                    <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><em>When Trippy had first jogged lightly down the tunnel to see if there was anything worth seeing, finding a mechanical drill is the last thing she had expected. By the time she was harvesting gems and minerals near the ruins of Blingdenstone as a child, no such machines were anywhere nearby. Once, accompanying her parents and three sisters on a mission to trade with the Duergar, her father had taken them on a half-day detour to see one of the few ancient mines that was still safe to enter. Here, the remnants of several such technomagical wonders lay disused, their crystal power cores long since spent and their operators&#x27; lives likewise extinguished. T≈ôpyt√≠vy had asked her parents if the great machines had been operated by her own forebears, but her mother had given no reply and her father had merely tilted his head from side to side as if he was either uncertain of the answer or unwilling to provide one. This episode was indelibly etched in her memory, capturing her imagination. She had often daydreamed of building such a behemoth as a battle machine to use against the Illithids.</em>

<em>Thus these many score years later, T≈ôpyt√≠vy&#x27;s childhood self is evoked by this strange circumstance. Dashing back to her companions, she had whispered breathlessly to them of her remarkable find‚Äîpaying virtually no heed to whatever they were preoccupied with‚Äîbefore darting over to the bedroll and fire pit. She had rapidly tossed these looking for clues, but her attention was in no way focused on what she was doing. In her mind, she was already operating the drill.</em>

<em>Moments later she is once again scooting down the tunnel, heart set on getting the wonderful machine running, and the reason for coming here in the first place all but forgotten.</em></span>

Faintly aware of Trippy&#x27;s frantic and excited story of a machine to dig with. It makes very little sense to her and she is preoccupied with going through the pockets of the body, looking for clues to his identity and purpose, while she out of the corner of her eye can see Imhra take the book and open it. 

Maybe this man was the source of the ray of light. But, how and why? And, maybe more importantly. Who had killed him so violently.</span>

<em>Time seems to stop for a moment, dragging out their experiences of otherwise small things.</em>

<em>Imhra holds the book in her hands, open to the page it had been on when it fell. It appears to be a journal, with mathematical calculations, star charts, and writings in celestial. There are also annotations--scribbles, circled figures and underlined words, and notes in the margins and between lines. These are written in sylvan, and Imhra&#x27;s eyes catch on &quot;only three days&quot;, &quot;on the lake&quot;, and &quot;need to start the eruption.&quot;</em>

<em>Qarin, Ailluin, and Rook see the body of the fallen stranger stir. There is a sickly glow that briefly emanates from the walls of the cavern, and then rushes in, to and through and past the adventurers, and into the figure on the ground. He slowly begins to rise to his knees, and beneath his body is a sword, the hilt of which one hand painstakingly takes hold. His expression, now that it is animate, is one of pain and hatred. And he stares right at Qarin.</em>

<em>And Trippy, her hands on the controls of the digging machine, suddenly feels it whirr into life. The massive drill spins at a glacial pace through the air, while the machine itself rumbles around the gnome. But there is something wrong. In this prolonged moment, Trippy can sense that there is a problem with the device, a malfunction. Is it too hot in the control booth?</em>

<em>All of these things happen in a moment, but those experiencing them feel like they can see every detail of the object of their focus in this second of stopped time.</em>

When she recovers her wits, she hops inside, making an attempt at re-jigging the controls in order to stop this huge, renegade machine she started, before rolling out again and striking it both with her sword and with her foot. As it rolls away from her she strikes out at it again, punching another hole in its plating with the tip of her sword.</em>

<em>Throughout all of this action that takes place during only ~15 s, T≈ôpytiv√Ω keeps her eyes shut and is almost completely silent, the only sounds coming from her the forceful sniffs through her nose as she delivers each sword-strike or kick, and the whisper-quiet swish of her wraps. She knows she&#x27;s done considerable damage to the drill, but also that such a large machine can withstand tremendous abuse. Although it is rather interfering with her ability to stay hidden in the dark, she is thankful that she had procured this magical blade to replace her family heirloom warhammer she had been so ineffective at wielding.</em>

<em>She is about to pursue the drill as it... retreats? Can that be? But she hesitates, her combat experience telling her something is amiss. Then she feels the drill dramatically increase its heat output, and leans back as the burst of flame in all directions doesn&#x27;t <strong>quite</strong> graze her.</em>

She moves closer, a thought striking at her. If this man&#x27;s time is going backwards, does that mean his violent death was theirs? As if their attacks had already happened when they found him? 

A headache starts to form behind her eyes.

She gets closer again and concentrate on her healing magic.

Gray and silver dust dance around her and move to envelop the stranger. She keeps her eyes on him and the healing seems to hurt him. 

&quot;There is time distortion here! He is going backwards as we go forwards!&quot; She says out loud for them all to hear. &quot;We killed him before we got here.&quot;</span>

This place, that drill... these are more suitable to her skills than the battle on the lake floor, or even that in the swamp. She still wonders if she should not learn to use a bow. She finds your facility with it most impressive, and she is tired of been so useless in ranged combat. &quot;

<em>She looks at the others, considering, and approaches them.</em>

&gt;     &quot;She is accustomed to being left in the dark‚Äîpun intended. However, this situation is certainly among the most mystifying she has experienced among the mysteries to which she has been party over her many years. You all seem to have some grasp of what happened here. She merely wished to destroy a machine that took one of her childhood dreams from her. Perhaps one of you would care to explain to her your understanding of this highly unusual scenario.
&gt;     &quot;But that can wait for the boat ride back to the mainland. Let us exit through this tunnel and light a fire on the beach as a beacon. She has a torch we can use. Then she will return here to ascend the rope and re-collect her gear while we await our passage back to the mainland.&quot;</span>

She learned how to weave garments <strong>and</strong> how to weave a bit of magic into the clothes!
&gt;     &quot;She feels that we have all fought for and protected each other this day. She would gladly make them for only the cost of materials, say, 25 gold pieces? She will begin as soon as we return to a location where she can sit and concentrate on the job for a few hours.&quot;

<em>Outside is the slope of the volcano, barren as it was before. Trippy is able to climb quickly to the top and retrieve her grappling hook and the loops of rope hanging from it. On returning to her companions she takes a view of the lake from the volcano&#x27;s rim.</em>

<em>From this northeast vantage, it looks like there is a steep dropoff--perhaps a cliff-- over to the east, not far from where the others wait. And, interestingly, there is a small piece of wood, waving through the air, right past the edge of this cliff.</em>

<em>The companions spend the few minutes moving toward this sight, and their confusion is very quickly dismissed. The wood is the top of the mast of the very same boat on which they arrived. It is now settled in the water beneath a recessed overhang, on which the adventurers stand. It would take little more than anchoring a rope to a boulder up there and then climbing down--for the second time this day--to land on the boat&#x27;s deck. And someone acrobatic might be able to simply leap the gap, grab on to the mast, and climb down its handholds.</em>

Trippy brings the rope up one more time, releasing it from its anchors and coiling it over her shoulder and around her torso. Thus relatively lightly laden, and leaving as little of her gear behind as possible, Trippy gives herself a 5-pace running start and leaps to catch the mast.</em>

She attempts to catch one of the other rigging lines, but her arm gets caught in her rope where it loops messily from her shoulder in the tumble. Her head catches on a shroud, snapping her neck forward, which disorients her so that she no longer has any possibility of controlling her tumble.

Maybe it&#x27;s best this way.</em>

<em>And if on the way she rubs shoulders or palms once or twice with her partners... well, they&#x27;ve had a few close calls. Their first, really, since arriving through portals and mists.</em>

&quot;Hey there! Your lad is a sharp cookie, we&#x27;ll be down in a moment!&quot;

<em>She stretches her arms over her head, popping a few joints, before pointing at where Trpytivy is setting up the rope already.

She grips the rope and blows a kiss to Rook and Imhra before she with a overly confident smile lowers herself out over the edge. 

<em>No person is meant to do that, unless wings were a gods-dammed natural part of your anatomy.</em>

It goes surprisingly well. 

That is until there&#x27;s 15ft left and her gauntlet clad hand slips and she first slides then falls down the the to tumble straight into Ailluin. 

&quot;By his left ball!*

She rolls to her feet. &quot;Sorry about that Ailluin. I completely lost control. Didn&#x27;t intend for you to have to catch me like this. Are you okay?&quot;</span>

<em>He does not say that last part out loud of course, but it is hard to ignore the sweet fragrance of <strong>spring</strong> around him. Foolish? Maybe, but an Eladrin and emotion are nearly one and the same. The seasons do change after all.</em>

A bit of color to brighten the day. She slips the flower into the scarf covering her hair and twist the flower behind her ear, so it pokes out of the scarf.  

She hears the sound of the falling Trippy in time to step out of her way so she is not bowled down when the small woman faceplants into the deck. 

&quot;Trippy! By the gods most high!&quot;  But Trippy doesn&#x27;t move.

After making sure that Trippy is alive, breathing and as comfortable as she can be, Qarin joins Imhra and Rook, giving each a smile and a caress on their cheek before she plops down next to them. 

&quot;What a day.&quot; she says and fingers her ruined clothes. 

When Ailluin starts telling his stories to the boy, she listens with half an ear. &quot;Didn&#x27;t know the man had so many words in him.&quot; 

&quot;Rook, is he a shape changer? I&#x27;ve seen his eyes turn green several times.&quot;</span>

<em>Half a dozen counter metaphors tease the tip of her tongue. But it&#x27;s been a long day, and picturing tortuous path of trading and testing wisdom leaves her a touch weary.</em>

<em>So with a yawn, she slides down the bulwark, eases Qarin&#x27;s legs down, smooths the torn silks there, and plops her head down in the woman&#x27;s lap, letting her curls smush every which way.</em>

<em>She blows a few loose ones off her face, silently inviting Qarin to do something about the mess, and makes herself comfortable, watching the play of the diffuse gloom over the sails and close faces.</em>

<em>But when Imhra sings, her throat bobs up and down once, and she stares upside down at the blonde bard&#x27;s hidden face with an inscrutable look. And then she picks up the tune, ever so softly, and translates the words and the sentiment in common for Qarin.</em>

<em>For all Sam and Lev are relieved and jubilant, the boat trip seems to last too little. Rook hoists herself up with a small pout and helps her lovers to their feet, dusting and smoothing their torn, rumpled clothing.</em>

&quot;Only the best words, Lev. Promise. And remember, you guys need coin or a hand, you let me know.&quot;

<span class="pre pre-inline">The transit wagon rocks to the gait of the horses pulling it along the remote cart track. She had spent the last three months in Giant&#x27;s Run, negotiating the resettlement of several small Galena Dwarven clans displaced by Cyricist Expansion. Last night she had drunk too much mead at the diplomatic banquet in Eversult but, blessedly, she was feeling mostly alive thanks to the restorative prayers of Nakovaljnya, her Dragonborn counterpart from Djerad Thymar.  Nako had admonished her, keeping his normally booming voice to uncharacteristically moderate levels, &quot;T≈ôpytiv√Ω, every few years you do this to yourself. Cutting loose is all well and good, but if you do it so infrequently its benefits are lost. Drink less mead more often, little friend.&quot; Nevertheless, The Anvil, as the the other ambassadors called him (it was, after all, not only the meaning of his name, but also his approach to diplomacy: he&#x27;d sit there and take it for hours on end until the hammers broke, then speak his piece decisively) had soothed her pounding head and her roiling stomach.</span>

<span class="pre pre-inline">The bed of hay she lay on is comfortable, the sun shines pleasingly on her dark skin, and the birdsong from the moors is cheerful. The Halfling wagon-driver, Brimblethub, chatters amiably, telling his typical ribald tales, and Trippy finds Nako&#x27;s guttural chuckles soothing.</span>

<span class="pre pre-inline">Suddenly, a stinging blast of water smashes her face and she sits up spluttering and looking about wildly. There, a mere several paces to her right, standing up out of the moor to her full 17-foot height, a humanoid of elemental water glares down at them. A Marid? Here? What the...</span></span>

An uneven trail of water stretches from the port gunwhale more than halfway across the deck, aimed with what could be mistaken for deliberate precision for the spot where Trippy&#x27;s face had lain against the boards worn smooth by the tread of the father-son duo&#x27;s boots. She makes to dash for the gunwhale, but the pain radiating across the front of her torso stops her. It all comes back to her: the leap, her foot catching in the rigging, the tumble, the snap in her neck... She needs healing.</em>

<em>Reaching down to her waist, her heart sinks. The two potions in her belt pouch are lost, the glass shattered in the fall. Those alchemy flasks are surprisingly durable, but there&#x27;s only so much they can take. She looks about for her pack and, spotting it where someone has kindly lashed it to the base of the main mast, she half-crawls to it. There should be one potion left in it, cushioned by her bedroll. With shaky hands, she undoes the outer buckle, and loosens the interior compartment drawstring. She gently and near-reverently lifts out the potion‚Äîthe first and, so far, only potion she has hand-crafted using ingredients she gathered on the rescue mission and applying the skills she learned just recently in Barovia Village. She gulps it down and KA-POW! Her taste buds light up with a near-ecstatic response! Never has she tasted such a delicious potion. She</em> <strong>knew</strong> <em>those mushrooms, mottled and wrinkled as they were, would be the perfect addition to the recipe!</em>

<em>Her ribs remain tender and her neck aches slightly, but she feels invigorated. She is an amazing Herbalist! And a magical clothier, now, too! With clients, even if they are friends paying only the cost of materials. Her parents would be so proud. They had always wanted her to become an artisan and a merchant.</em>

<em>What should she learn next? Hmmm...</em></span>

&quot;They do,&quot; she concedes to him. &quot;not here though, do they? No where to go.&quot;  her voice is quiet and wistful and her eyes touch the grey horizon. &quot;Your wisdom is not incorrect, but its circumstances have changed.&quot;

She filters her fingers into Rook&#x27;s hair, gathering it behind her head, absentmindedly braiding a lock then two as she hums along to Imhra&#x27;s singing and Rook&#x27;s translating watching more flowers spout from Ailluin&#x27;s flute. She flicks her fingers and silver dust swirls from her, rising and turning, like starlings painting the sun black. 

And suddenly the ship is full of activity and Trippy is away and the sails are being stowed and ropes moored and Rook leaps from her lap, half a braid sticking out a little awkwardly above her ear. 

Qarin grins and goes to Lev. &quot;Thank you. You saved my life with that shot. And gave us passage. I don&#x27;t know what Lady Wachter will pay you. But it cannot be enough. &quot;

She reaches into her coin pouch and pulls out fifty gold pieces. &quot;I am not aware of the value of things here in these gloomy lands. But, here is my token of appreciation for what you have done for me and for us today. 

If you are ever in need of a healer or any help, I will come to your aid, no questions asked.&quot;  She puts the coins into the man&#x27;s hand and closes his finger around them. &quot;My name is Qarin, prophet, seer and mystic for the Mysterious One. 

And with that she too disembarks trying not to think too hard about the fact that she has just willingly given money for a service already paid. <em>Now, there is a first time for everything.</em></span>

Discovering the tiny, winged creature behind the burgomaster recalls to Trippy&#x27;s memory the odd fluttering sound she had heard near Imhra in the cavern, but given no heed. In the midst of the quick, ugly, and ultimately decisive battle, she had dismissed the leathery flapping as a rogue bat scared out of hiding but, now, she grows suspicious. Hearing Rook&#x27;s words, Trippy opens her eyes, her attention drawn to the book.</em>

&gt; &quot;Dear Baroness,&quot; <em>she begins,</em> &quot;our service to you was quite costly. She has spent no less than 150 gold coins worth of potions and other, less valuable items on this endeavour. Our lady Qarin was moments from dying in blood-clouded water due to the predations of the merfolk. We knew that undertaking this quest for you was hazardous. However, what we did not anticipate was that you would send along with us your own active, unseen observer. She cannot blame you for providing some insurance against our possible incompetence given that you did not know us when this all began‚Äîand still do not, though likely you now know much more of us than we should otherwise expect, given your informant&#x27;s advantages. Nevertheless, we placed ourselves in great peril in order to unravel a mystery that we were unable to resolve with any degree of satisfaction.&quot;</span>

&quot;To answer your question on patronage: yes, most certainly! I am burgomaster of Vallaki, and therefore I am beholden to Lord Strahd, in whose realm of Barovia Vallaki lies. By assisting me and Vallaki, you have assisted the lord as well. This should be of no surprise, what with Madame Qarin admitting to taking Lord Strahd&#x27;s guidance as well.&quot;

&quot;If one was to think of the Weave as a body of water--like the ocean, or no, perhaps an underground lake that spreads beneath all the world--then it would follow that there could be waves upon its surface.&quot;

&quot;No, I see how you look at me. I do not claim this to be true, merely the theory laid out in this journal. Suspend your disbelief.&quot;

&quot;The theory suggests that there may be certain circumstances in which waves in the weave may travel in such a way as to create incredible concentrations of magic. These circumstances require two parts: first, a place steeped in magic, where this proverbial body of water is very deep; and second, it must be enclosed. The description given to  illustrate this is of a cup of water into which one drops a stone, and the height of the splash at the center once the waves bounce off of the cup&#x27;s walls and then meet up once again. Barovia, it appears, has both of these characteristics.&quot;

&quot;That is one part of it. Another is the idea of &#x27;convergence,&#x27; I believe of planes. If one supposes that all planes of existence are superimposed one on the other, but inaccessible without a great concentration of magic... Well, you see where this is going, right? Make a big enough splash in a small enough plane, and all realities may well become mixed up in the process. Convergence. I believe the light&#x27;s appearance were glimpses of exactly that, as the waves through the weave bounced off of the mists and returned to the center, apparently on the cadence of one day.&quot;

&quot;The calculations for when the Weave would be &#x27;sufficiently deep&#x27; are beyond me, but suffice to say, we are not due for another such opportunity for millennia.&quot;

&quot;So now we know where and why, which leaves, I think, only the how.&quot;</span>

&quot;The details of that are unclear, but from what you experienced, I believe the following is not too far from the truth. Whether intentionally or not, this person you encountered inverted their entropy, and experienced time opposite to how we do so. That, I imagine, was the initial catalyst for the waves in the Weave, and then some activity by his machine, controlled autonomously, perhaps by a command he uttered, triggered the volcanic eruption and further amplified them. Would that he were still alive on the third day, doubtless we would have been experiencing his crazed vision for all of reality.&quot;

&quot;Do you believe in fate, in destiny? You all, and I too, had thought that <em>I</em> sent you to that island.

He had failed in his quest as soon as it began, and we were seeing the aftereffects of that failure.&quot;

<em>Trippy is no expert in such complex philosophies and metaphysics, but her Githzerai master did tutor her in some matters of planar arcana and how one might strengthen or weaken the boundaries. He had told her of the Amethyst Greatwyrm that had helped his people escape their enslavement many thousands of years ago by punching a hole in the boundary between the prime material plane and the astral. This was done from inside a world utterly unlike the one she had recently left‚ÄîToril and its cosmos. He had also described to her how his great-grandfather was present for those events‚Äîthough a very young man at the time. She had asked him with considerable consternation how he could be only four generations removed from such an event thousands of years past if his people only lived for a bit less than a century, and he had attempted to explain how time had expanded in one place and condensed in another... T≈ôpytiv√Ω had dearly wished to know more, and this could be her chance!</em>

<em>Ailluin looks out the window, over the garden and out into Vallaki where its citizens go about their day, or well night in this matter. A small town in the shadows. They have no idea how small their world is.</em>

<em>He turns and walks backs to his companions, the last whispers of winter have fogged the window he left, leaving what looks vaguely like intertwining roots that will slowly fade.</em>

‚ÄúThe Black Dahlia, My Lady is a flower of mystery, much like this tale you have told. Keep it, eat it, destroy it, plant some more, do with it what you may.

But, she reasons with herself, maybe the Lady is correct. What is done is done and what is said is said. There&#x27;s no turning back time. 

<em>Or, apparently there is. But the means to do so is beyond me.</em> Seeing as how little she understands the talk of weaves and convergence and whatnot.

She forces her brain down other paths. And if the lady wants to believe that she is in direct contact with Lord Strahd himself... well then why disabuse her of the notion.

That too makes her uneasy. Because the voice had not been the regular one. The implications of that reality are too far reaching for her to untangle in couple of seconds, but, was he listening to every thought and prayer the people of Barovia let through their heads? Chills runs down her spine. <em>What have you gotten yourself into, Cali? And how the fuck do you get yourself out of it again?</em> 

Qarin looks around the room to find Trippy has disappeared and Ailluin is making his goodbyes. When he takes her hand she smiles to him. A man of ice and flowers and apparently planes. It is most intriguing. 

&quot;I have no wish to shake them, ranger of Silendril, but I would like to meet you again. I do hope our paths cross in the future.&quot; she gives him a wide smile and a small curtsey, raising her eyebrow in slight surprise as his lips graze the back of her hand. 

When the ranger leaves she gives Rook and Imhra a bemused look then turn to Lady Wachter. &quot;I will take my leave. I hope Vallaki will remain safe in your care.&quot; 

She curtseys again and then leave.

<em>... She does spin a gripping yarn, doesn&#x27;t she? Good breeding shining through. Rook files away a few details about Barovia and its implications, and finds herself wondering the type of stress someone like the burgomaster must be in, with droves of powerful adventurers in her streets.</em>

<em>As for fate... that&#x27;s a question that&#x27;s been hounding her since the bottom of the caldera. She watches her partners, rolls her eyes at Ailluin&#x27;s propositioning Qarin with all the grace of a rockfall, then she makes the gold and the rose disappear in her cloak.</em>

&quot;... I believe, Lady Wachter, that had we or you chosen differently, today might have been a sunny day indeed.&quot;
